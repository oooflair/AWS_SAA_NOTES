1️⃣ What is a Subnet?
    A subnet is a range of IP addresses within a VPC.
    Subnets divide a VPC into smaller networks.
    Each subnet resides in one Availability Zone only.
2️⃣ Subnet Rules
    ✔ Subnet must be within VPC CIDR range
        Example
          VPC CIDR:
            192.168.0.0/16
          Valid:
            192.168.10.0/24
          Invalid:
            10.100.10.0/24 ❌
    ✔ Subnets cannot overlap
          Invalid:
            10.0.0.0/24
            10.0.0.128/25   ❌
          Valid:
            10.0.0.0/25
            10.0.0.128/25
    ✔ Subnet size limits
            CIDR	Total IPs
            /28	    16
            /27	    32
            /26	    64
            /25	    128
            /24	    256
            /16	    65,536
            Minimum subnet size: /28
            Maximum subnet size: /16
3️⃣ AWS Reserved IP Addresses: 
    ✔ AWS reserves 5 IPs per subnet.
      Example (10.0.1.0/24):
      Address	    Purpose
      .0	        Network
      .1	        AWS Router
      .2	        DNS
      .3	        Reserved
      .255	      Broadcast
  ✔ Usable IPs = 256 − 5 = 251

4️⃣ Public vs Private Subnet: Subnet type is decided by route table, not by name.
      ✔ Public Subnet
          0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway
          Internet accessible
          Public IP required
      ✔ Private Subnet
          No IGW route
          Uses NAT Gateway for outbound internet
5️⃣ Subnet Communication: 
     ✔ Subnets inside the same VPC communicate by default
          Controlled using:
              Security Groups
              Network ACLs
6️⃣ IPv6 Support
       ✔ Subnets can be:
            IPv4 only
            IPv6 only
            Dual stack (IPv4 + IPv6)
7️⃣ Auto-Assign Public IP
      ✔ Optional per subnet
      ✔ Automatically assigns public IPv4/IPv6 on launch
8️⃣ Subnet Deletion Rules
    ❌ Cannot delete subnet or VPC if it contains:
          EC2 instances
          Load balancers
          NAT Gateways
          Network Interfaces (ENI)
    ✔ Deletion order:
          Terminate/move instances
          Delete NAT Gateway
          Delete Load Balancers
          Remove ENIs
          Delete subnet
          Delete VPC
9️⃣ Key Exam Points
          Subnets must lie within VPC CIDR
          Subnets cannot overlap
          One subnet = one Availability Zone
          Route table decides public/private
          AWS reserves 5 IPs per subnet
          Cannot delete subnet with running resources

🔁 Example Architecture
        VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
        Public Subnet:   10.0.1.0/24
        Private Subnet:  10.0.11.0/24

📌 One-Line Definition
      A subnet is a logical subdivision of a VPC that defines an IP range and resides within a single Availability Zone.
